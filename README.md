## Projects

Here are some of the semester-long projects I've completed:

1. [Security Scripting Project]([link-to-project-1](https://github.com/kaledunlap/Security-Scripting)): This project was focused on utilizing scripting languages to create scripts that could be used for security assessments, data analysis (data manipulation; textual manipulation), and automating administrative security tasks.
2. [Firewall & Network Security Routing]([link-to-project-2](https://github.com/kaledunlap/Firewall-and-Network-Security)): Designed, implemented, and monitored a network security plan. Followed by examining security incident postmortem reporting and ongoing network security activities.
